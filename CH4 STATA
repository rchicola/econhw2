*Input and print Matrices for Dr. Sorensen's HW2 Chapter 4 question 2
matrix A = (2,1,5\1,2,5)
matrix list A
matrix B = (1,0\0,1)
matrix list B
matrix C = (2,2\1,1)
matrix list C
matrix D = (2,2,3\1,1,5\1,4,5)
matrix list D
matrix E = (6,3,7\3,4,8\3,7,5)
matrix list E


*Part A What is B^-1 ?(Inverse of B)
matrix Binvsym = invsym(B)
matrix list Binvsym

*Part B What is C^-1 ? (Inverse of C)

*matrix Cinvsym= invsym(C)
*matrix list Cinvsym
*Attempting to run Cinvsym results in "Matrix not symmetric" error 
*this is because there is no inverse as the Determinant =0 =(2*1)-(2*1)

*Part C What is A' (A Transpose)?
matrix ATrans = A'
matrix list ATrans

*Part D What is B' (B Transpose)?
matrix BTrans = B'
matrix list BTrans

*Part E What is C' (C Transpose)?
matrix CTrans = C'
matrix list CTrans

*Part F What is A x C ?
*matrix AtimesC = A * C
*matrix list AtimesC
*Attempting to run AtimesC results in "conformability error" A s a 2x3 and C s 
*a 2x2 so we would have to take transpose of A first to make conformable to 
*which is what part G asks next.

*Part G What is A'xC?
matrix ATranstimesC = A'*C
matrix list ATranstimesC

*Part H What is BxC ?
matrix BtimesC = B*C
matrix list BtimesC

*Part I What is B+C?
matrix BplusC = B+C
matrix list BplusC

*Part J What is D^-1 D inverse? You can use software for this
matrix Dinverse = inv(D)
matrix list Dinverse
*invsym could not be used because not symmetric (D not equal to D transpose)

*Part K What is DxE? You can use software for this
matrix DtimesE = D*E
matrix list DtimesE
